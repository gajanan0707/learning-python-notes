    "Dynamic typing in Python refers to the language's ability to automatically determine the data type of a variable at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I assign a variable a value like this → a = 3 → these steps happen\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An object is created with the value 3\n",
    "2. A variable a is created \n",
    "3. A variable a is linked to a new object with value 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Links from variables to objects (a chunk of memory) are called references. A reference is a kind of association, a pointer in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object has two header fields: a *type designator* used to mark the object and a *reference counter* used to determine when it’s OK to reclaim the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables don’t have a type, objects do. In this case:"

    "Whenever a name is assigned to a new object, the space held by the prior object is reclaimed if it’s not referenced by any other name or object. The automatic reclamation of object’s space is known as *garbage collection*. In the previous case, each time a is assigned to a different object, Python reclaims the prior object’s space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python accomplishes this by keeping counter in every object that keeps track of the number of references currently pointing to an object. A soon as the memory drops to 0, the object’s memory is reclaimed. \n",
    "\n",
